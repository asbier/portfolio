    description: "In 2017 About You was a multi-brand e‑commerce platform going for the mainstream, with competitors in the picture. Personalisation was already happening; the brief was to make us competitive. The UK had already embraced influencer-led, identity-driven retail; Germany was still catching up. That was the context we worked in — and what I created is below.",
    
    challenge: "The main challenge was surviving on the market as a multi-brand platform for the mainstream — with competitors in the background. We sold other people’s brands, so controlling look and feel was difficult; we had to give those brands a platform they trusted and wanted to sell on. We also had to attract and retain customers and create a clear reason to come back. On top of that, the platform idea itself had to be translated into a coherent experience across product, marketing, and brand. The direction we took was to put people in the centre — give them control, make it about them. It’s ABOUT YOU: inspiration and identity, not just shopping. The UK had already moved that way; Germany hadn’t yet. EDITED had shown the model could work; we executed it.",
    
    process: "First a new look and feel; then we made the brand personalisable — starting with the logo’s name usability, an idea I brought to the table. Rebrand concept and stories and direction followed. We created idol campaign and collaboration, social media redesign, and different model bookings, aligned with global everyday faces and a shift in Germany’s marketing landscape towards more diversity, more you. That same thinking opened the door to the About You Awards, a campaign created by the About You team; I helped represent EDITED and contributed ideas to make the Awards more interactive.",
    
    impact: "A few core ideas drove my impact. A personalisable logo (About Anna, About Maria, About Simon) put the person at the centre. Stories and editorial to the front made the platform feel like inspiration, not product grids. Idol campaigns and collaborations gave icons a stage and bridged social, e‑commerce, and the real world — at retail and events. I pushed for everyday, diverse faces so people could see themselves in the brand, and for future concepts around recycling and circular identity. The result: a brand as perception, open for everyone to interpret and shape. Ten years on, that mix is still the foundation of their identity.",
    
    outcome: "That direction caused a playful, emotional creative journey — one platform idea turned into stories, idols, collaborations, and a personalized brand experience — and led to the idea of the About You Awards.",

Across her films, novels, and columns for Vogue and FAZ, Reisinger draws on Barbie, Polly Pocket, Sisi, and women's-magazine imagery to play with female clichés and the tension between victim and perpetrator. This poster channels that same language — glamorous, sharp, and deliberately provocative.",
    challenge: "Translating that tone into one image. Main inspiration: Barbie, beauty contests, and women as victim or perpetrator in film — themes that drive Tarantino, Lynch, and Fassbinder, yet in a male-dominated frame. I drew on their visual styles to create something new: staged tableaux, sharp glamour, pink as a provocative statement, and the film’s mix of comedy, fairy tale, parody, and drama — without flattening its ambivalence between empowerment and objectification.",
    impact: "A bold, festival-ready poster that leans into “bad taste” as strategy: glamorous, absurd, and confrontational. More books and films in that direction have gone mainstream since — a theme that also hit Hollywood. If Jovana's work inspired Greta Gerwig's Barbie — who knows? A key visual that held its own at the festival and beyond — unapologetic, provocative, right in the middle of that conversation.",
