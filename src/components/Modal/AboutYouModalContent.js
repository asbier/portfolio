        <h1>About You</h1>
            <p>
                ABOUT YOU is one of Europe’s leading fashion e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing online shopping through personalization and digital innovation. 
                Launched in 2014 by the Otto Group, the platform merges content and commerce, offering a curated and inspiring shopping experience driven by AI and influencer collaborations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016/2017, I contributed to the brand’s creative direction and rebranding efforts, working on strategy, personalization, and user experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Case 1 — Holistic Marketing Strategies</h2>
           
            <p>
                I contributed to the strategic shift as ABOUT YOU transitioned from a niche e-commerce platform to a mainstream brand, focusing on diversity, inclusivity, and personalization. 
                I ensured that the platform’s structure, content, and branding strategies aligned with these shifts, fostering deeper connections with a broader customer base.
            </p>

            <p><strong>My Idea & Strategy</strong></p>
<ul className="checklist">
  <li className="fontWeight">Shift from white-background catalog images to engaging real-life content with diversity & inclusivity.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Shareable Content </li>
  <li className="fontWeight">"Stories" to tell – Outfits curated for every occasion. Clothes are grouped into editorial narratives, making it easy to find the perfect look.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Elevate the brand philosophy: "It's About YOU —giving meaning to "AY."</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Personalization: Features like name-based greetings (e.g.,"It's About Julia") for a tailored experience.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Editorial must be cutting-edge, collections launched like high-fashion drops.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Emphasize emotions, cultural diversity, and an international vibe.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Inspired by Zara, ASOS, and high-fashion brands.</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">High-quality Streetwaer communication style .</li>
  <li className="fontWeight">Collaboaration with Celebrities - "I want to wear what Gigi H. wears" - " I want be be like my Idol" Starting with C&B Celebs - going up to A. </li>
</ul>

            <h2>Emily & Eve new AY Shoe Brand Concept </h2>
            <p>
                I visualized the CI of the new Shoe Brand, we created a Social Media and extra Brand Internal Webshop on AY.
                This was the Start for AYs own Label Presentations. A follow up was Lena Gerkes ( Ger-Next-Top-Models-Winner) brand LeGer.
                Here I also did Logo and some Fashion Design Research and Graphics in the Berlin Studio.

        <h2> Holistic Marketing Strategies with ProSieben as Partner</h2>
            <p>
            I conceptualized the award designs and booths for 
            the second ABOUT YOU Awards, unlocking their full potential after the first edition fell short. <p></p>
            My Brand Manager then positioned us as the Creative Team for both EDITED and ABOUT YOU to maximize impact.
            The event celebrated influencers as key advocates for our brand, marking 
            the first awards of their kind in Germany and elevating ABOUT YOU’s presence 
            in both German and European markets. <p></p> 
            Additionally, I worked with my Brand Lead to design booth and 
            label presentations for EDITED and ABOUT YOU, ensuring a strong, immersive presence. 
            The booth concept resembled a vibrant backstage lounge where nominees 
            could connect and create. To enhance the experience, various brands 
            showcased their latest products, offering interactive elements 
            from food to fashion. Under the motto IT’s ABOUT YOU, guests personalized 
            bags, socks, jeans, and more, making the space dynamic and engaging.

            <h2>Case 2 — Influencer and Celebrity Engagement</h2>
            <p>
                I developed the “Celebrity X” initiative to incorporate well-known public figures into campaigns, 
                making the brand feel more relatable and authentic, while directly engaging with a broader user base.
            </p>
            <p>
                I collaborated with renowned external designers and influencers, creating strategic partnerships that elevated the brand’s 
                visibility and market positioning. Additionally, I worked on co-branded campaigns that aligned the ABOUT YOU aesthetic 
                with established fashion icons, 
                making the platform more appealing to a larger audience.

            <p>
                I designed innovative store concepts and pop-up events to enhance the brand’s 
                physical presence and improve consumer interaction with the platform. 
                Additionally, I developed branding strategies for high-profile events 
                that aligned with the company’s vision of creating an engaging and immersive shopping experience.
