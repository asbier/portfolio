      HELLO, THIS IS PLASTIC MEDIA.‚Äù ¬©PLASTIC MEDIA</strong></p>

      <p>Here I had my first design-related experiences with international customer contact.  
      Under the mentorship of Art Director Daniela Bily and Creative Director Kira Stachowitz,  
      I learned how to channel my skills and creativity within the realms of editorial design, brand marketing, and public relations.  
      We designed the Monki Magazine, four issues of INDIE Magazine, and Material Girl Magazine.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we worked with clients like Tally Weijl and Hennessy, creating brand experiences  
      that invited people to immerse themselves in unforgettable events filled with pleasure and fun.</p>

      <h3>INDIE Magazine</h3>
      <p>INDIE Magazine is a renowned independent fashion and culture publication that originally started in Austria before relocating to Berlin.  
      Founded by Plastic Media and Kira Stachowitz (Creative Head), along with Clemens Steinm√ºller (Chapter Magazine),  
      the magazine quickly gained international recognition for its bold aesthetics, avant-garde storytelling, and fresh take on youth culture.</p>

      <p>While its origins lie in Austria, INDIE evolved within Berlin‚Äôs dynamic creative scene, embracing the city's progressive and experimental spirit.  
      The magazine merges fashion, art, and cultural commentary, showcasing both emerging talents and established voices.  
      With a strong emphasis on visual storytelling and edgy editorial design, INDIE remains a pioneering force in independent publishing,  
      bridging Austrian craftsmanship with Berlin‚Äôs underground energy.</p>
