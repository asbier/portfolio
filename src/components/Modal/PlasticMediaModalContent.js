Here I had my first deasign-related experiences with International customer contact.
With the Art Director and personal mentor Daniela Bily and CD Kira stachowitz I learned how to use my skills and creatvity in a very free space of Editorial Design, Brand Marketing and Public Relations. We designed the Monki Magazine, 4 Isssues of INDIE and the 
Material Girl Magazine. Aswell we had clients like Tallej Weijl or Hennesy and created a Brand Experience where we 
invited people for a day or night of pleasure and fun.
