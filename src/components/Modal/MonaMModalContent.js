            <h2>Album Art Creative Direction</h2>
            <p>For this unique collaboration, I worked closely with Mona M. during the pandemic to create album artwork that captures the essence of her experimental electronic music. The project required a blend of analog and digital techniques, incorporating mask-making, set design, and filming to produce visually striking content.</p>
            <p>The creative process involved exploring themes of identity and technology through visual storytelling, using innovative production methods that mirror the artist's own approach to music creation. The resulting artwork challenges traditional boundaries between analog craftsmanship and digital artistry.</p>
