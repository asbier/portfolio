        <h4>Problem</h4>
        Comma needed a fresh approach to engage a younger audience while retaining its appeal to an older demographic. 
        The catalog, previously similar to a brochure with small product images and numbers, 
        required a redesign that would highlight the new collection and elevate the brand‚Äôs image. 
        Additionally, the project aimed to translate this new editorial direction into a compelling and 
        seamless e-commerce experience.


        <p><strong>I was brought in to create an editorial lookbook that went beyond simply showcasing the collection.</strong> 
        <p></p>The solution was to develop a dynamic, visually rich zine-style magazine that provided styling inspiration, brand insights, and a deeper connection with the models and materials used in the collection.

To address the needs of the younger demographic, I focused on a collage-driven approach, incorporating serif-less typography, bold patterns, and a modern aesthetic, while keeping the colors and typography grounded in classic design elements. This blend of modernity and tradition captured the essence of the brand while appealing to a younger audience.

Recognizing the need for a seamless integration between the physical magazine and the online shopping experience, I worked with the developer to translate the design into the digital world. The collage style and parallax scrolling effects were incorporated into the web version, creating a dynamic and immersive online shopping experience.

The result was a holistic design concept where both print and web came together as a cohesive brand experience, delivering a consistent aesthetic across all platforms.
</p>
<p><strong>The web concept won an award for its innovative parallax scrolling and collage style. </strong>The redesign resonated with both younger and older audiences, creating a cohesive print-digital experience driving success.
