    <p><strong>DAYONE provides innovative consulting and design services for digital transformation. ¬© DAYONE</strong></p>
    <p><strong>As Product Designer at DAYONE,</strong> 
    I balanced design, leadership, and strategy, taking ownership with minimal oversight. 
    I focused on a holistic approach, from UX to business strategy, integrating user 
    research and product ownership into the design process. My main client was Volkswagen.</p>

<p><h2>My first challenge was working with Accenture Song on the International Volkswagen OneHub, a highly political environment.
    Collaborating with different teams, I had to navigate varying goals and workflows.
    Being new helped me approach challenges with fresh perspectives.</h2></p>

  <h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>
  <p> To gain clarity, I focused on research and extensive questioning to understand Volkswagen‚Äôs 
    objectives and user pain points. Through User Days, we discovered that users struggled to find specific cars due to Volkswagen‚Äôs offline sales legacy.</p>

  <h3><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
  <p> With these insights, 
    I proposed a simple yet effective solution <strong>
      ‚ÄúThe Category Slider.‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>During these discussions, I opened Pandora's box, sparking thoughts about a more holistic approach. 
  This led to the birth of the Holistic Filter Initiative. As a result, we launched both quantitative 
  research through heatmaps and qualitative research during a User Day, where, with the support of Ipsos, we interviewed 
  five car owners who were either about to purchase or had recently purchased a vehicle.

      <p>üí° <strong>Learning</strong> Even though my idea wasn‚Äôt initially welcomed, it opened up new opportunities that led to a deeper understanding of what users truly need and ask for.
      This is a great example of how I like to work‚Äîtransforming a small idea into a big change with a positive outcome for the user.</p>
