        <h3><strong>Challenge</strong></h3><p></p> My first to do, was working with Accenture Song on the 
        International Group Stock Locator on Volkswage's OneHub (Central Content-Management- und Experience-System), 
        a highly political environment.
        Collaborating with different teams, I had to navigate varying goals and workflows.
        Being new helped me approach challenges with fresh perspectives.<p></p>

          <p><strong>What is the Group Stock Locator at Volskswagen?</strong></p>
          <p>The GroupStockLocator integrates new and pre-owned
stock-car offerings into every relevant micro-moment for the
customer to enable an engaging digital brand experience while
driving both online- and offline-sales.<p></p>
Instead of having separate StockCar platforms with less
connection to the digital VW ecosystem we create a seamless
onsite experience with all car buying options at hand - from
configurator-built new cars to local dealer-offers for used cars.<p></p>
</p>

        <h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>
        <p> To gain clarity, I focused on research and extensive questioning to understand Volkswagen‚Äôs
          objectives and user pain points. 
          Through User Days, we discovered that users struggled to 
          find specific cars due to Volkswagen‚Äôs offline sales legacy.</p>

        </figure>
        <h3><strong>Outcome 1</strong></h3>
        <p> With these insights,
          I proposed a simple yet effective solution <strong>‚ÄúThe Category Slider.‚Äù</strong><p></p>
          To simplify the buying decisions for certain user groups, a new personalized GSL Category 
          Entry Slider is introduced on the GSL Content Page as well as on the Product List Page.<p></p> 
          Those Category filter gives users more guidance to find their desired type of 
          vehicle so that they can make a better purchase decision.
          ‚ÄúFinding my dream car faster‚Äù by using the Lifestyle Categories which fits to each user needs is
           the overall goal of this new filter approach. <p></p>

          <figcaption className="image-caption">Outcome of the Category Slider</figcaption>

        <p>During these discussions, I was sparking thoughts about a more holistic approach.
          This led to the birth of the Holistic Filter Initiative or later called Global Filter Experience. 
          As a result, our Design Team launched both quantitative
          research through heatmaps and qualitative research during a User Day, where, with the 
          support of Ipsos, we interviewed
          five car owners who were either about to purchase or had recently purchased a vehicle.

          <figcaption className="dayone-image-caption">Examples show possibilities of new Objektives</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This lead then to a whole new Vision, which was to do a Holistic Search, where we created
        <ul class="checklist">
      <li className="fontWeight">New GSL Stage Feature App (simple entry into the search)</li>
      <li className="fontWeight">Category Filter Pre-sets on the GSL Content Page</li>
      <li className="fontWeight">Integration of the Filter-Cockpit</li>
      <li className="fontWeight">Smart ‚ÄúFilter Suggestion‚Äù for mobile</li>
      <li className="fontWeight">User-friendly Detail search</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

        <figure className="dayone-image-gallery">
         
          <img src={Image7} alt="Design Outcome" />

          <video ref={videoRefs[1]} src={video2} muted loop playsInline></video>
        </div>

        <p>üí° Even though my idea wasn‚Äôt initially welcomed, it opened up new opportunities that led to a deeper understanding of what users truly need and ask for.
          This is a great example of how I like to work‚Äîtransforming a small idea into a big change with a positive outcome for the user.</p>
