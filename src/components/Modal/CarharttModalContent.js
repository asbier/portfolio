        <strong>Carhartt Work In Progress (Carhartt WIP)</strong> forms a division of the 
        American brand Carhartt, one of the first companies to pioneer workwear in the USA. 
        Founded in Europe in 1989, 100 years after Hamilton Carhartt established his business in Detroit, Carhartt WIP 
        has been carefully adapting and modifying Carhartt's core product characteristics for a different audience of 
        consumers who value refined design and quality while still remaining true to Carhartt's brand origins.

        <h3>Help Desk development</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            Inifficient Customer Support.
            Users struggled with accessing 
            help and support, making it difficult for them to resolve issues efficiently on both the web and app platforms.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            I conducted benchmark research, identifying key pain points and understanding the needs of our target audience. I mapped out the user journey to highlight friction points and collaborated directly with developers to ensure technical feasibility. We presented my findings and solutions to the dev team, ensuring alignment on user needs and design requirements.
        </div>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            I developed intuitive user flows and interfaces that made it easier for customers to access support, track their requests, and receive timely updates. The improved design significantly reduced service request resolution time and increased customer satisfaction.

        <h3>Checkout Experience Optimization</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            The checkout process was cumbersome, particularly for users in the U.S. and EU-Markets, which led to higher cart abandonment rates and a frustrating user experience.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            I worked closely with Digital Design Lead, and SEO Marketers to understand market-specific needs and user behavior. We all collaborated on addressing friction points in the checkout flow. I ensured the design was aligned with SEO best practices to enhance discoverability and conversion.
        </div>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            I redesigned the checkout system, optimizing mobile usability, improving the filter system, and simplifying the overall flow. The new design streamlined the purchasing process, resulting in lower cart abandonment rates and higher conversions.

        <h3>Transitioning Design Tools from Sketch to Figma</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            The team was facing challenges in collaboration due to the limitations of Sketch, and it was crucial to transition to a more flexible design system.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            I worked closely with the Design Lead to evaluate Figma‚Äôs features and its potential to improve workflow.
        </div>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div className="modal-section">
            By transitioning the design system to Figma, I improved team collaboration, allowing for real-time feedback, seamless handoffs, and more efficient workflows. This also improved consistency across design outputs and made cross-functional collaboration smoother.
