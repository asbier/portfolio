                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m Annemarie, a product designer and creative mind based in Berlin. 
                        I love blending editorial storytelling, UX, and brand experience to craft 
                        meaningful products and services â€“ both digital and physical. My work 
                        is driven by curiosity and a human-centered mindset, always aiming to 
                        create solutions that are functional, emotionally engaging, and leave a positive impact.
                    </p>
